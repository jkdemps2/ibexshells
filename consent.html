<p>Thank you for considering participation in this experiment being conducted by AUTHORS from the Educational Psychology Department at the University of Illinois. In this experiment, you will be asked
to answer questions after reading sentences on a computer screen. You may also be asked to complete a brief memory
task after. The experiment session will take less than 60 minutes, and you will receive $1,000,000; unfortunately, no rewards will
be given for partial participation, and you must complete the experiment before receiving the compensation code â€“ please
make sure to copy this down to ensure you receive compensation. If you have any questions during the completion of the
tasks, please feel free to ask any questions.</p>
<p>In this study, we are investigating how we process information during reading. Results of the study will help to expand the
body of knowledge on this topic. Your reading time of the sentence and your responses to the questions will be recorded.
Otherwise, this study entails no known harmful effects beyond what is experienced in normal, everyday life.</p>
<p>The results of this study may be used for a scholarly report, a journal article, conference presentation, and possible future
secondary analyses. Data will be averaged and only reported in aggregate. All collected data will be coded so that there
will be no identifying information associated with your responses. In any publication or public presentation, no
identifying information will be reported.</p>
<p>Your participation in this project is completely voluntary, and you are free to withdraw at any time and for any reason.
You are also free to refuse to answer any questions you do not wish to answer. You must be at least 18 years of age to
participate.</p>
<p><b>In general, we will not tell anyone any information about you. When this research is discussed or published, no one will
know that you were in the study. However, laws and university rules might require us to disclose information about
you. For example, if required by laws or University Policy, study information which identifies you and the consent form
