<h2><b>Welcome to the experiment!</b></h2>
<br />
In this task, you will be doing math problems while trying to remember letters.
First, you will see a simple math problem like:  (2x2)+3 = ?
Press space when you have solved the problem. 
Then, you will indicate whether an answer provided matches the correct answer by clicking "Yes" or "No" on the subsequent screen (or by pressing "F" for correct and "J" for incorrect). 
For example, if you see the solution "7" on the next screen, 
you would click "Yes" because (2x2)+3 = 7.
<br /><br />
After judging the accuracy of the math solution, you will see a letter. 
Try to remember the letters following each math problem as you 
will have to report them back during a later memory test. <b>Please only type letters in lower case.</b>
<br /><br />
If you have any questions, notify the experimenter now.
